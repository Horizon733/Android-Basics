These are my projects that I had made for Udacity NanoDegree Program
### 1st Project - Tour Guide app
This app provides info about all the locations in Mumbai city where a Tourist can go. 
Also, there is Foods that tourist would love to eat.

### 2nd project - News app
This app connects with the Guardian API to get news related to technologies.

### 3rd Project - Media player app
This app has only UI and needs some futhure changes like: play music and user library that will be committed soon.
